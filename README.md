# Predicing Return To The Office


## Project Summary
This project was created using a self-collected dataset via a Google Docs form. The main objective of my analysis was to answer the question: "Can you predict if office workers will want to return to the office after the COVID pandemic has subsided based on external factors?". The modeling I chose for this project was logistic regression in R utilizing R Studio.
